# AC-iOS Final - Practical

## Objective

Build an Instagram-like app for posting images with comments.

## Summary

The app comprises three view controllers: a feed, an upload page and a login page. The designs to follow
will illustrate and specify the design and relationship of these view controllers.  The backend will be powered by Firebase.

## Login

Users are required to log in before they can access the rest of the app.

## Main View: Feed

Each post in the feed has two elements: a picture and a comment. The picture is a fixed square the width
of the device and the text is variable height below it, resulting in non-uniform cell heights.
Therefore use Auto Layout to drive automatic cell heights.

## Upload View

## Backend

### Authentication

Use Email/Password authentication to you can register and log users in.

### Database

The simple schema is illustrated by this diagram.  This will probably make the most sense for your app.

### Storage

The file structure of the storage is illustrated here:

![Database Schema](readme_assets/storage.png)

Note the relationship between image names and objects in the database.  You can use the same UID for both.

#### Uploading Images

Be sure to render your images into compressed JPEG format as we did in the review.
Here's a line of code that takes a ```UIImage``` and generates a ```Data``` object
with JPEG data.

```swift
let image: UIImage = ...obtain uiimage somehow...
let data = UIImageJPEGRepresentation(image, 0.5)
```
